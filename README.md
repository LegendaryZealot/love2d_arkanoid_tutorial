This tutorial describes how to write a more or less full-featured [Arkanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid) ([Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_%28video_game%29)) clone. 
While simple, it contains many elements found in more elaborate games.

My aim is to introduce some common constructs, used in game programming, 
and to provide a starting point for further modifications.  

Lua programming language and [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) framework are used.
Basic programming experience is assumed.
Familiarity with Lua and Love2D is beneficial but not necessary.
Some non-obvious Lua idioms and briefly explained.

Each step can be run with `love` interpreter by issuing a `love` 
command followed by a folder name, for example

    cd /your-path/love2d_arkanoid_tutorial
    love 01_TheBallTheBrickThePlatform 

One last thing before we start: feedback is crucial.
If you have any critique, suggestions, improvements or just any other ideas, let me know. 

An explanation of each step can be found on
[github wiki](https://github.com/noooway/love2d_arkanoid_tutorial/wiki).
